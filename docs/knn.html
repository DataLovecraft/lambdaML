<h3 id="About:">About:<a class="anchor-link" href="#About:">&#182;</a></h3><p>K-nearest neighbors(KNN) algorithms is a type of surpervised machine learning algorithms^*. It is a lazy learning algorithm since it doesn't have a specialized training phase. Rather, it uses all of the data for training while classifying a new data point or instance. KNN is a non-parametric learning algorithm, which means that it doesn't assume anything about the underlying data.</p>
<h3 id="Theory:">Theory:<a class="anchor-link" href="#Theory:">&#182;</a></h3><p>Simplest of all the surpervised machine learning algorithms. It calculates the distance of a new data point to all other training points. The distance can be of any type e.g Euclidean or Manhattan etc. It then selects the K-nearest data points, where K can be any integer. Finally it assigns the data point to the class to which the majority of the K data points belong.</p>

<ol>
<li>Go through each item in my dataset, and calculate the "distance" 
from that data item to my specific sample.</li>
<li>Classify the sample as the majority class between K samples in 
the dataset having minimum distance to the sample.
