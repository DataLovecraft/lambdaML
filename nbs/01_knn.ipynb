    "### About:\n",
    "\n",
    "K-nearest neighbors(KNN) algorithms is a type of surpervised machine learning algorithms^*. It is a lazy learning algorithm since it doesn't have a specialized training phase. Rather, it uses all of the data for training while classifying a new data point or instance. KNN is a non-parametric learning algorithm, which means that it doesn't assume anything about the underlying data.\n",

    "### Theory:\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplest of all the surpervised machine learning algorithms. It calculates the distance of a new data point to all other training points. The distance can be of any type e.g Euclidean or Manhattan etc. It then selects the K-nearest data points, where K can be any integer. Finally it assigns the data point to the class to which the majority of the K data points belong.\n",
